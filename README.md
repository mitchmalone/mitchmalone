Hi, I'm Mitch! 👋 I am a post-technical product and engineering leader with `24+` years of experience in software engineering, product management, and engineering management. I have recently returned from a <a href="https://nomadmo.re/maps/2023-world/">career break traveling in Europe</a> with my wife and I am available for consulting, advisory and board engagements.

I have been a remote worker for `13` years, and I've spent `7` years as a digital nomad.
During that time I visited `33` countries and worked from `340` distinct locations. Check out
my travel map of locations <a href="https://nomadmo.re/maps/the-full-travel-map/">here</a>.
