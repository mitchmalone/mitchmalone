Hi, I'm Mitch! I am a post-technical product and engineering leader with `23+` years of experience in software engineering, product management, and engineering management. I have recently returned from a <a href="https://nomadmo.re/maps/2023-world/">career break traveling in Europe</a> with my wife and I am **available for work**.

I have been a remote worker for `12` years, and I've spent `7` years as a digital nomad.
During that time I visited `32` countries and worked from `336` distinct locations. Check out
my travel map of locations <a href="https://nomadmo.re/maps/the-full-travel-map/">here</a>.
